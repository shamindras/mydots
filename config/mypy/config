# Note: this is the global mypy config file. The order in which the config are
# read are as follows.
# First look for `mypy.ini` with a fallback to `.mypy.ini`, then 
# `pyproject.toml`, then `setup.cfg` in the current directory, 
# then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mypy/config`, then `~/.config/mypy/config`, 
# and finally `.mypy.ini` in the user home directory if none of them are found;

# Typically in practice it is best to just use a `pyproject.toml` in the project 
# root directory.

# Global options:
[mypy]
