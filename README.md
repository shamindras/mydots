# mydots

This is a repo of my personal dotfiles for `macOS`. The main philosophy is to
use

*Warning: these dotfiles are currently a work in progress (not yet complete).
Feel free to take Inspiration from them, but don't use them as is.*

- a [modern unix](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) workflow.
- the [`XDG`](https://github.com/mattmc3/zebrafish/blob/main/zebrafish.zsh#L13-L36)
  file specification for `macOS`.
  - This is risky, but keeps things organized in the home directory.
