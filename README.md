# mydots

This is a repo of my personal dotfiles for `macos`. The main philosophy is to
use

- a [modern unix](https://github.com/ibraheemdev/modern-unix) workflow.
- the [`XDG`](https://github.com/mattmc3/zebrafish/blob/main/zebrafish.zsh#L13-L36)
  file specification for `macos`.
  - This is risky, but keeps things organized in the home directory.

## Inspiration

These dotfiles have been inspired by the following (and many more) people. I
thank them for openly sharing their work.
